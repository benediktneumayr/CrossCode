*Code 39*

Compare the pictures: The latter is standard Code 39 barcode. What's the problem with it? It can only encode information using horizontal strokes. However, CrossCode, which is the former one, can also utilize vertically aligned strokes to form a grid with line crossings for more efficient encoding. These encode the information: If a horizontal line crosses a vertical one, this represents 1. If not, it means 0. The charset used is standard ASCII (from 0 -127).
