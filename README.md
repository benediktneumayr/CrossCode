**CrossCode - A new, simple 2D barcode**

This is standard Code 39 barcode. But what's so bad about it? It can only encode information using horizontal strokes. But CrossCode can also utilize vertically aligned strokes to form grid with line crossings. These encode the information: If a horzontal line crosses a vertical one, this represents 1. If not, it means 0. The charset used is standard ASCII (from 0 -127).
